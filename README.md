# Wanna Match?

This is a matching game I created based on Udacity's Memory Starter Project. I forked it, added my own images/art, enhanced the functionality, and personalized it. Simply click on two matching pictures until all are matched! To restart and shuffle the cards, click the reset button at the top. Each card you click will increment the move counter. Enjoy!
