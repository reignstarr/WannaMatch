# Wanna Match?
This is a matching game I made based off of Udacity's Memory Starter Project. I forked it and added my images/art, funtionality and made it more my own. Basically just click the two pictures that match and do it until you match them all! Click the reset button at the top if you want to restart (it will shuffle the cards). Each card you click will add on to the move counter. I hope you enjoy!
